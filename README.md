Here's a simple and practical .bat (batch) file script that will automatically create a folder using the current date and time (formatted like 05-JULY-2025) in E:\RAJDEEP when you run it:

âœ… BAT File Script: create_dated_folder.bat
bat
Copy
Edit
@echo off
:: Set drive and parent folder
set "parent=E:\RAJDEEP"

:: Get date and format it
for /f "tokens=1-3 delims=/.- " %%a in ('date /t') do (
    set day=%%a
    set month=%%b
    set year=%%c
)

:: Handle different regional date formats (like DD-MM-YYYY or MM-DD-YYYY)
:: Try to detect the year based on length (assuming 4-digit year)
if "%year:~2,1%"=="" (
    :: Year is probably %%a
    set "year=%day%"
    set "day=%b%"
    set "month=%c%"
)

:: Convert numeric month to name
set monthname=
for %%M in (
    "01 JANUARY" "02 FEBRUARY" "03 MARCH" "04 APRIL"
    "05 MAY" "06 JUNE" "07 JULY" "08 AUGUST"
    "09 SEPTEMBER" "10 OCTOBER" "11 NOVEMBER" "12 DECEMBER"
) do (
    for /f "tokens=1,2" %%x in (%%M) do (
        if "%%x"=="%month%" set monthname=%%y
    )
)

:: Format final folder name like 05-JULY-2025
set foldername=%day%-%monthname%-%year%

:: Create folder if not exist
set "target=%parent%\%foldername%"
if not exist "%target%" (
    mkdir "%target%"
    echo Folder created: %target%
) else (
    echo Folder already exists: %target%
)

ðŸ”§ How to Use:
Copy the script above.

Save it as create_dated_folder.bat.

Double-click to run it.

It will create a folder like E:\RAJDEEP\05-JULY-2025 automatically.

If the folder already exists, it wonâ€™t recreate it.

ðŸ§  Notes:
Works on most Windows systems.

If your system date format is different (like YYYY/MM/DD), let me know â€” I can tailor the script accordingly.

You can add time too in the folder name if needed, like 05-JULY-2025_14-30.
